# TO DO
- change login do not update front login display -> relogin still return old login to the front but new login is needed to log (so it work)
- logout button do not appear after 2FA signup
- login 2FA after email change gives auth_view error : {"error": "Invalid login credentials!"} (2FA works anyway)
- upload a new profile picture refresh the website (but work well)
