- login 2FA after email change gives auth_view error : {"error": "Invalid login credentials!"} (2FA works anyway)
~~- upload a new profile picture refresh the website (but work well)~~
- /transchat/ cleanup
- random profil url that does not exist (ex https://127.0.0.1:8080/profile/dwqddwq) in direct access from url browser bar break the website
- Add as friend button on other users profiles
- signup message 'conflict' for already in use login: not clear
- pong URL and history not working
- this.main.set_status in red for success of commands like changed password ok
- 'next match' in tournament for result page (skip it if return to lobby ?)
